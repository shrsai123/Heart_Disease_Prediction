### **UCI Source**

UCI dataset created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, **5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features** which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. 

The five datasets used for its curation are:

- Cleveland: 303 observations
- Hungarian: 294 observations
- Switzerland: 123 observations
- Long Beach VA: 200 observations
- Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations

**REPORTED NUMBERS:** 
*We discovered 3/17 that the UCI dataset may contain far more duplicates. Only the Cleveland dataset of 303 patients has been used in ML and validated as real patients. It is suggested that the Stalog Dataset is actually the Cleveland set duplicated (Simmons paper).*

Total: 1190 observations

Duplicated: 272 observations

`Final dataset: 918 observations`
